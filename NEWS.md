## v0.1.9

* `partition_bundle` replaces `partitionBundle` in code and documentation (#9).
* `store()` method removed - storing mallet objects is intended usage, so code
is captured in an issue of biglda package.
* `papply()` is removed: `pbapply::pblapply()` is the consolidated state-of-the-art.
* Documentation etc fixed so that R CMD check yields OK.
